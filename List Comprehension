# List Comprehensions is a very powerful tool, which creates a new list based on another list, in a single, readable line.

# Q: create a list of integers which specify the length of each word in a certain sentence, but only if the word is not the word "the".

sentence = "the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog"
words = sentence.split()
words_length = []
for word in words:
    if word != "the":
        words_length.append(len(word))
print(words)
print(words_length)

-----------
sentence = "the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog"
words = sentence.split()
words_length = [len(word) for word in words if word != "the"]
print(words)
print(words_length)

# Q:2  create a new list called "newlist" out of the list "numbers", which contains only the positive numbers from the list, as integers.

numbers = [34.6, -203.4, 44.9, 68.3, -12.2, 44.6, 12.7]
newlist = [int(n) for n in numbers if n>0]
print(newlist)
